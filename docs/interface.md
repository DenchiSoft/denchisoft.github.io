This page will go over the VTube Studio interface. The example used here is the mobile app, but this all applies to the desktop applications as well.

After selecting a model, it will be shown on screen. You can move, rotate and scale it using normal smartphone controls.

When clicking the __"Show Camera"__ button, the camera preview window (1) will appear (smartphone only). On Android, this Window may be black if something went wrong with the ARCore setup. Check the log if that is the case.
