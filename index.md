### What is VTube Studio?

VTube Studio is an app available for **iPhone/macOS** (*currently in review*), **Android** and **Windows**. The app uses your smartphone to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/) accordingly. The model is shown directly on your phone or on your PC by streaming the face-tracking data over your local network from your phone to your PC/Mac.

From there, you can use OBS or any other streaming software to create videos and livestreams using your Virtual YouTuber Live2D avatar. Interested? Here's a small preview:

### What do I need?

You need a smartphone (iPhone or Android) and a PC (if you want to stream on PC). Supported smartphones:

- **iOS:** iPhone X or newer (must support ARKit)
- **Android:** Any Android device that supports ARCore (see [this list of supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)).

The app is **free** to try out, so just download it and see if it works on your phone!
