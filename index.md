### What is VTube Studio?

VTube Studio is an app available for **iPhone/macOS**, **Android** and **Windows**. The app uses your smartphone to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/) accordingly. The model is shown directly on your phone or on your PC by streaming the face-tracking data over your local network from your phone to your PC/Mac.

From there, you can use OBS or any other streaming software to create videos and livestreams using your Virtual YouTuber Live2D avatar. Interested? Here's a small preview:

### What do I need?

You need a smartphone (iPhone or Android) and a PC (if you want to stream on PC). Supported smartphones:

- **iOS:** iPhone X or newer (__must support Face ID__)
  - iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS (regular and Max), iPhone 11 (regular, Pro and Pro Max),
  - iPad Pro (3rd, 4th+ generation)
- **Android:** Any Android device that supports ARCore (see [this list of supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)).

The app is **free** to try out, so just download it and see if it works on your phone! If you like it, you can buy the PRO version to remove the watermark from the app and enable unlimited face streaming!
