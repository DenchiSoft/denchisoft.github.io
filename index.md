### What is VTube Studio?

VTube Studio is an app available for iPhone/macOS (*currently in review*), Android and Windows. The app uses your smartphone to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/) accordingly. The model is shown directly on your phone or on your PC by streaming the face-tracking data over your local network from your phone to your PC/Mac.

From there, you can use OBS or any other streaming software to create videos and livestreams using your Virtual YouTuber Live2D avatar. Interested? Here's a small preview:
